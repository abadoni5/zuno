# Zuno App
Zuno is a mobile app for remote dementia care, empowering caregivers to provide 24/7 care without physical presence.


## The Problem
Caring for dementia patients is a costly and time-consuming task for caregivers and healthcare providers. Patients with dementia often require 24/7 care, resulting in a heavy burden on caregivers who may have to sacrifice their personal time and work. Healthcare costs associated with caring for dementia patients can also be exorbitant.


## Our Solution
Zuno is a mobile application for dementia patients, and web portal for caretakers, that addresses the challenge of caring for dementia patients, by enabling remote care through a user-friendly and secure portal. With Zuno, caregivers can provide 24/7 care to their loved ones without the physical presence, reducing the burden of caregiving and the associated costs.
Zuno offers a range of features that optimize the care delivery process, including live location tracking, a vault for personal documents, a people you know page, personal reminders, and medication reminders. The live location tracking feature ensures that caregivers can monitor their loved ones' movements in real-time, while the vault for personal documents securely stores medical records, insurance information, and other important documents.


## Features
-	Reminders and prompts: Zuno sends reminders and prompts to help patients remember important tasks, such as taking medication or attending appointments.
-	Memory games and activities: Zuno offers memory games and activities that can help stimulate the brain and support cognitive function.
-	GPS and location tracking: For patients who are at risk of wandering or getting lost, Zuno comes with GPS and location tracking features could help caregivers keep track of their loved ones and ensure their safety.
-	Vault: Enables the patient to securely save important documents in one place for easy access.
-	“People you know”: Helps you add people with their images so that you never forget your loved ones.

It's important to note that not all patients with dementia will be able to use an app independently, and that caregivers will likely play a key role in supporting their loved ones to use the app effectively. Therefore, we have designed a web portal that enables the caretaker to keep track of the patient. The caretaker can directly update patients, get notifications when the patient leaves the house, set reminders as well as track their condition improvement through memory games.
